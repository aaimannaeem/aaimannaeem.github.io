tags: [blog]

Android OS powers millions of apps on a range of smartphone devices. These apps are able to perform a number of actions including setting up your daily alarm or addressing unique business requirements. The Android community is quite popular when it comes to designing applications with great user experience and compatibility.<br>

For this post, I have composed a slide-by-slide <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GR7knOrNDzlFbxDifI0eLxKfkEdpNn29/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">guide</a>, targeted towards beginners looking to gain some experience in the initial stages of Android App development. Building apps is quite a creative and fun task when it comes to Android Studio.<br>

For the purposes of this beginner's guide, I made use of traditional Powerpoint slides. Since I had to communicate very precise information, a slideshow seemed the most appropriate way.
