This project was part of my Bachelors Thesis. As part of this project, we developed an application in Python for computing the probability of occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in a person based on specified clinical indicators. Major frameworks under deployment were *Scikit-learn* and *TensorFlow*. Additionally, we worked on visualization schemes for analytics derived from patientsâ€™ electronic health records.
