This project was my Bachelor's Thesis. As part of this project, I developed an application for computing the probability of occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in a person based on specified clinical indicators using Python. Major frameworks used were *Scikit-learn* and *TensorFlow*. Additionally, I worked on visualization schemes for analytics derived from patientsâ€™ electronic health records.
