title: Why Germany?
tags: [blog]

Since I’ve taken up graduate studies, I often get these questions from friends, family and colleagues repetitively,


<center><strong>Why</strong> Germany?</center>


<center><strong>Why not</strong> USA, Australia or any other country?</center>



Here I try to cover, as I intricately as I can, my reasons and knowledge of facts which led me to choose Germany over other options:


* Free Tuition in majority of the technical fields (mainly Engineering and CS related)

* One of the world’s premier higher education systems

* Several funding opportunities available in the form of Research Projects, Internships and Student Assistantships

* High living standards with relatively low costs

* An economy giant with numerous work opportunities after graduation

* Pervasive multiculturalism

* Relatively easier visa process

* Public insurance takes really good care of your health needs

* Availability of 18-months Job Seeker Visa after graduation

* Access to all Schengen states for study exchange, work or just recreation!
