Across the world online grocery shopping has been growing for the past decade, with China, South Korea and Great Britain leading in terms of the industryâ€™s popularity. In Germany, on the contrary, online grocery shopping is only adopted in individual cases. The objective of this study is to develop a research framework that explains the key drivers of the intention to use online grocery shopping of German consumers. The proposed framework incorporates Technology Acceptance Model 3 predictors and several external variables such as Product Involvement, Trust and E-Shopping Quality. Its composition is based on literature analysis and three qualitative workshops. For the framework evaluation, the data collected from 213 participants is analysed using structural equation modeling. The study strongly supports the proposed framework with job relevance, e-shopping quality, perceptions of external control and enjoyment being the strongest predictors of behavioral intention to use online grocery shopping.
