I've been thinking of starting a blog for a very long time, finally it's here. Currently, I am committing myself on doing one blog post per month though it'd be really great if I could
manage time for writing more often. Other than that, I also plan on sharing my projects here on the site. Let's see how this goes...

I should note that this website is hosted on Github Pages and is hence powered by Jekyll templating engine. Well why spend any money on cheap shared servers when Github provides truly free and extremely reliable, their own CDN-powered, hosting!
Plus, learning Jekyll was fun too. I've been building Wordpress based sites for more than 5 years now but working on a static blog without any PHP & SQL involved somehow felt really interesting. In fact I'd recommend everyone to check this option out when making personal blogs or small websites.
