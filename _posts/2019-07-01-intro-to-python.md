As an advocate of open source and e-learning, I dedicated my efforts this week in drafting a beginner's <a href="https://github.com/faizanzafar40/Intro-to-Programming-in-Python">tutorial</a> for programming in Python. This tutorial is targeted towards anyone looking to learn programming and Python from scratch. I strongly believe in learning with practice and thus have included several scripts and programs to individually explain basic and intermediate concepts. Moreover, I have included a total of 8 PowerPoint Presentations which cover all basic programming concepts, so do refer to them when starting out.<br>

The reason why I chose Python is because it is an easy-to-learn general purpose language, with widespread applications in scientific computing, web development and artificial intelligence.<br>

Initially, I had to experiment with a few platforms for communicating the contents of this tutorial. However, I found Github to be the most optimal resource. It's pretty simple to use and highly recommended for budding programmers and tech enthusiasts.<br>
