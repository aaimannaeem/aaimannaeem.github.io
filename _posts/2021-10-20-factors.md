Operational processes in the care sector are becoming increasingly digitalized due to rising workload. Insufficient involvement of caregivers in this digitalization process results in poorly integrated technological developments along with a lack of technology acceptance. Therefore, in order to lay a firm foundation for successful technology development, it is utmost essential to understand the intention of professionals to use technology in outpatient care. This paper develops a model that outlines the factors influencing the intention of caregivers to use digital technologies in outpatient care, based on a case study examining the introduction of a textile sensor mat. In the developed model, the care situation is investigated for the first time as a factor influencing the intention to use digital technologies, in addition to technology acceptance. Apart from deriving the factors of the model and inspecting the strength of their influences, the practical relevance for technology developers in other care contexts is also determined.
