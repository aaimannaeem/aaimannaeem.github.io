Here I try to cover, as I intricately as I can, my reasons and knowledge of facts which led me to choose Germany for graduate studies:


* Free Tuition in majority of the technical fields (mainly Engineering and CS related)

* One of the worldâ€™s premier higher education systems

* Several funding opportunities available in the form of Research Projects, Internships and Student Assistantships

* High living standards with relatively low costs

* An economy giant with numerous work opportunities after graduation

* Pervasive multiculturalism

* Relatively easier visa process

* Public insurance takes really good care of your health needs

* Availability of 18-months Job Seeker Visa after graduation

* Access to all Schengen states for study exchange, work or just recreation!
